# ParticleParticle
A simple simulation model based on particle-particle electrostatic interactions written in C and in object oriented C++.
This was one of the 2 numerical methods used for my dissertation on calculating the inverse square law rapidly using this model as a benchmark with complexity O(n<sup>2</sup>).
